### Project Description
DevVoice is a VS Code extension that allows developers to record and play voice explanations for specific code blocks.
It helps users understand, revise, and revisit code by capturing the reasoning behind the logic in spoken form.

### The Problem statement
Developers often forget why certain logic was written, especially when revisiting old code or learning new concepts.
Text comments are time-consuming to write and often fail to capture the full intent behind the code.

### The Solution
DevVoice enables developers to attach short voice explanations directly to code blocks inside VS Code.
These audio notes stay separate from the source code, keeping files clean while making code easier to understand, revise, and explain.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- Languages used: JavaScript,TypeScript,JSON
- Frameworks used: VS Code Extension API
- Libraries used: Node.js built-in modules,
   VS Code provided APIs
- Tools used: Visual Studio Code, Node.js, npm, Git


## Features

List the key features of your project:
-  Code-Block-Specific Voice Recording : Allows developers to record voice explanations for a selected block of code directly inside VS Code.
-  Audio Playback Within the Editor : Enables users to replay recorded explanations anytime while viewing the associated code.
-  Non-Intrusive Design : Voice explanations are stored separately and do not modify or clutter the source code files
- Learning & Revision Support : Helps students and developers revisit logic, understand reasoning, and revise code more effectively using audio explanations.

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram](images/SYSTEM_ARCH.jpeg)

DevVoice is designed as a layered VS Code extension architecture that cleanly separates user interaction, core logic, and storage.
This ensures simplicity, scalability, and non-intrusive integration with the editor.

**Application Workflow:**
